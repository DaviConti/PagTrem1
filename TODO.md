# TODO: Transform Menu to PHP

## Completed Steps
- [x] Transformed `public/menu.php` from static HTML to PHP by adding session_start(), including `config/db.php`, updating links to .php files, and fixing script paths.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the menu page by starting the XAMPP server and navigating to `public/menu.php`.
- [ ] Verify that links to other PHP pages (e.g., dashboard.php) work correctly.
- [ ] Check for PHP errors and ensure session handling is consistent across pages.
- [ ] Optionally, make menu items dynamic using database data from `config/routes_functions.php` if needed.
