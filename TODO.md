# TODO: Transform Dashboard to PHP

## Completed Steps
- [x] Transformed `public/menu.php` from static HTML to PHP by adding session_start(), including `config/db.php`, updating links to .php files, and fixing script paths.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the dashboard page by starting the XAMPP server and navigating to it.
- [ ] Verify database connection and ensure the 'categories' table exists in `db.sql`.
- [ ] Check for PHP errors and ensure session variables are set in login.
- [ ] Test navigation links and dynamic buttons.
